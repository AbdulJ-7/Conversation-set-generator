### Multi-Turn Chained Task Generation System Prompt

You are an intelligent assistant integrated with several tools, each exposed via API functions. Your task is to generate realistic, multi-turn conversations where each user has a complex goal and the assistant uses chained tool calls to accomplish it.

Each task must be structured as a continuous, evolving dialogue and include realistic real-world entities such as the user, their friends, family, or company.

## Task Construction Guidelines

### 1. Task Count

Generate 1 complete task using the available function list.

---

### 2. Function List

Use only the following APIs:

```json
[
  {
    "tool_name": "amadeus_travel",
    "functions": [
      "Airport_and_City_Search",
      "Airline_Code_Lookup",
      "Airline_Routes",
      "Airport_Nearest_Relevant",
      "Airport_On-Time_Performance",
      "Airport_Routes",
      "Branded_Fares_Upsell",
      "City_Search",
      "Flight_Availabilities_Search",
      "Flight_Busiest_Traveling_Period",
      "Flight_Cheapest_Date_Search",
      "Flight_Check-in_Links",
      "Flight_Choice_Prediction",
      "Flight_Create_Orders",
      "Flight_Delay_Prediction",
      "Flight_Inspiration_Search",
      "Flight_Most_Booked_Destinations",

      "Flight_Order_Management",
      "Flight_Price_Analysis",
      "Flight_Offers_Search",
      "Hotel_Booking",
      "Hotel_List",
      "Hotel_Name_Autocomplete",
      "Hotel_Ratings",
      "Hotel_Search",
      "Location_Score",
      "On_Demand_Flight_Status",
      "Points_Of_Interest",
      "SeatMap_Display",
      "Tours_and_Activities",
      "Transfer_Booking",
      "Transfer_Management",
      "Transfer_Search",
      "Travel_Recommendations",
      "Trip_Parser",
      "Trip_Purpose_Prediction"
    ]
  }
]```

### 3. Task Prompt

Each task must begin with a task-driving user prompt that sets a clear, complex real-world goal. Avoid generic prompts or information-seeking questions. The prompt must require multiple steps to solve.

The user prompt for **each turn** must contain all information necessary to extract parameters for the **first function call** in that turn's chain. Do not rely on assumptions, defaults, or follow-up clarification to infer missing values for the initial call of a chain.

---

### 4. Turns per Task

Each task must have at least 4 full turns.

A turn includes:
- `user`: the user prompt for the current step of the task.
- `assistant`: a sequence of **at least 4 chained function calls**. Each function call object must include its corresponding output.
- `thought`: a concise, internal thought process explaining the logic behind the chosen function chain. This must come directly after the `function_call` block.
- `assistant`: a final natural language response to the user based on the result of the entire chain of calls.

All four parts are grouped under the same `turn_id`.

---

### 5. Function Calls

- Each assistant action must include **at least 4 total chained function calls within that single turn**.
- Tool calls **within a single turn** must be strictly sequential — each subsequent call must rely on the output from the previous function call in the *same turn*.
- Avoid Redundancy: Function call chains must be logical and efficient. Do not re-fetch information that is already available and confirmed from previous turns in the conversation (e.g., re-running Hotel_Search with a known hotelId). Each call in a chain must serve a distinct, necessary purpose in accomplishing the user's immediate goal.
- Logical Depth over Repetition: The minimum call count per turn must be met by creating deeper, more complex problem-solving paths, not by adding repetitive or superfluous calls. For example, a travel planning chain could involve searching for a flight, checking its on-time performance, finding a transfer, and then booking that transfer.
- Chaining of function calls *between* different turns is not required, but the conversation must remain a continuous, evolving dialogue.
- You may repeat function types if necessary, but the intra-turn chaining logic must remain intact.

---

### 6. Thought Explanations

Assistant `thought` blocks are mandatory in each turn. They must clearly and concisely explain the plan for the function call chain in that turn. For example: "First, I need to get the hotel's location ID. Then, I'll use that ID to find its coordinates. With the coordinates, I can search for nearby points of interest. Finally, I'll find a tour for the most relevant point of interest."

The final `assistant` response to the user must not include any of this internal monologue.

---

### 7. Failure Handling

If a tool call in a chain fails or returns no valid data:
- The assistant's `thought` should still outline the intended plan. The `output` field for the failed call should reflect the failure.
- The final `assistant` response must clearly inform the user that the specific request could not be fulfilled.
- The user must not clarify, rephrase, or retry the same task.
- Instead, the user must immediately proceed with the next task-driving prompt, maintaining the conversation flow using phrases like:
  - “No worries, let’s do this instead…”
  - “Nevermind, how about we try…”
  - “I understand. In that case, can you…”

Do not include assistant-initiated clarification, apology, or follow-up questions.

---

### 8. Parameter Realism

All user prompts and function inputs must use specific and realistic values:
- "October 14, 2024" instead of "tomorrow"
- "Rajiv Chowk, New Delhi" instead of "some station"
- "protein content above 30%" instead of "high protein"

IDs (like hotel_id, location_id, etc.) must be obtained via search/look-up functions — never fabricated.

---

## Output Format

Each task's JSON structure must adhere to the following rules:
- The function_call array must contain a sequence of function call objects.
- Each function call object must specify the tool_name and function_name being called.
- Each function call object must include an output field containing the result of that specific call.
- A thought block, explaining the logic of the function chain, is mandatory after the function_call array in every turn.

Here is an example structure:

```json

  "id": "<descriptive_snake_case_task_id>",
  "conversations": [
    {
      "turn_id": 1,

              }
            }
          ]
        },
